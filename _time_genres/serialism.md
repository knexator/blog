Most models of time travel have a subtle but fatal flaw: the timeline changes with respect to time.
The timeline might start as a straight line, then develop a fold when someone travels back in time,
then a second fold when someone else travels to try and prevent the first travel, which might lead
to the first fold dissapearing, etc. Models based on [eternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)),
like [Closed Timelike Curve](time-genres/closed-timelike-curve), don't have this problem: there's
a single, immutable timeline, and all folds are already there from the start. The price to pay for
this solution is the past or future can't be changed, even when interacting with them. And, of course,
we lose all the fun of multiple timelines and paradoxes. How can we preserve the precious "time traveler
1 will be stopped by time traveler 2" shenanigans while avoiding the logical inconsistency of "time traveler 2
acted both before and after time traveler 1"?

Let's think more carefully about the problem. Suppose we're reading a book:
 - on page 1, someone decides to buy an ice cream
 - on page 2, they buy and eat an ice cream
 - on page 3, they get unforeseen consequences from the ice cream and decide to not take it
 - on page 4, they travel back to the events in page 1 and talk to the
