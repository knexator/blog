Most models of time travel have a subtle but fatal flaw: the timeline changes with respect to time.
The timeline might start as a straight line, then develop a fold when someone travels back in time,
then a second fold when someone else travels to try and prevent the first travel, which might lead
to the first fold dissapearing, etc. So, which one is the _real_ timeline? Does only the last one count?
That can't be it, since the shape of the last timeline is influenced by the previous timelines. Wait,
what does _previous_ mean when we are talking about timelines? Models based on [eternalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)),
like the [Closed Timelike Curve](/time-genres/closed-timelike-curve) model, don't have this problem: there's
a single, immutable timeline, and all folds are already there from the start. The price to pay for
this solution is the past or future can't be changed, even when interacting with them. And, of course,
we lose all the fun of multiple timelines and paradoxes. How can we preserve these fun paradox shenanigans 
while having a formal model in which everything is well defined?

The solution is so natural and obvious that we rarely notice it's even needed. Suppose we're reading a book:
 - on page 1, one morning, someone decides to get some ice cream
 - on page 2, at noon, they buy and eat an ice cream
 - on page 3, during the afternoon, they get an upset stomach due to the ice cream
 - on page 4, that night, they travel back to the morning and prevent their past self from getting that ice cream.

This is a pretty straightforward time travel story. We have an intuitive sense of the events: the reunion of page 4
happens both before and after noon, but we don't see this as particularly problematic (even though it is!). Why?
Because we are understanding the story in terms of a linear, unchanging, temporal reference frame: the page numbers!
We can talk about the _first_ and _second_ mornings since one happens 3 pages _earlier_ than the other. As much as the
in-universe timeline gets distorted & changed, the page numbers (or the film's runtime, or the computer's clock) gives
us the grounding to apply our usual mechanisms of thinking about time & ordering. In other words, we understand the in-universe
timeline as another object, changing with respect to the _actual_ time. This is why [Primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film))
is more confusing than most time travel stories: the non linear storytelling removes the usual reference frame.

Now, let's say that after finishing the book, we jump back to a random page and start rewriting from there a new version
of the story. No amount of in-book time traveling can prevent our actions: we are messing with the _real_ timeline, the page number.
If we track these modifications, creating a collection of all the different versions of the book (each one created by taking the previous
and rewriting everything after some point), we end up with a meta-story about how the _real_ timeline of the page numbers is distorted.
In other words, we are back to the starting problem, but we can apply the same solution: different events might happen in both versions of page 4,
but one happens in Book 1.0 and the other in Book 2.0; it turns out the _real_ timeline of page numbers, while being more real than the story's
timeline, is less real than the version number timeline. These shenanigans have no end: every time we mess around with the most 'real' timeline,
there's an unaffected, linear, timeline in which we can track the order in which we have messed around.

This is a really powerful and general model. Any other time travel model can be seen in terms of this one, and it's often useful to do so
to keep track of how timelines change and evolve. It maps well to how we think about time travel: even when a story's events are overwritten
and rearranged, the order in which we learn of these modifications is well defined and immutable. My only gripe with this model is that representing
the full timelines requires an unbounded number of dimensions, which can quickly get unwieldy.

Anyways, here are some games that explore this model:

There's a common complaint about [Spicy Undo](/time-genres/spicy-undo) games: they lack a real undo! If there are objects immune to undo, moving
them wrong means having to reset the whole level. The natural solution is to add another layer of undo; wouldn't it be fun, though,
if there were objects that also resisted this extra layer of undo? This short block pusher examines this cursed territory. Higly recommended (I might be biased on this one)
