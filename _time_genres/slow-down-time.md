Time travel games often feature a convenient mechanic: slow down the world and/or yourself, to allow performing moves that would otherwise
require superhuman skill. This can be extended to allow literally impossible moves, such as climbing a time-frozen waterfall. I'm not
convinced that this mechanic deserves its own page: it doesn't affect causality, so it could go in [Linear Time](/time-genres/linear-time),
and the underlying model of time is the same as in [Spicy Undo](/time-genres/spicy-undo) (moving on a frozen world is equivalent to
continuously switching between undoing and not undoing, while being immune to undo). Still, the mechanic is used frequently enough to get it's
own category. Here are some games using it:

In Braid's 6th world, the player gets a ring that, when placed on the ground, will slow down time around it. While not strictly breaking
causality, having different parts of the world advance at different speeds creates the space for some interesting puzzles. The whole game
is of course extremely recommended.

Metroidvania in which the player has the ability to briefly pause time, which not only helps with combat but will allow them to use
enemies as platforms. I haven't played it.
