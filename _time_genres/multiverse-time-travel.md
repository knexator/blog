When trying to explain the [Standard](/time-genres/standard) model of time travel, tree-like diagrams are common: each travel creates a new timeline,
which we represent as a branch growing off the main timeline's trunk:

These diagrams are just a visual aid: parallel timelines aren't really "parallel", since the space in which they live has no geometry. What if we give
it one? That is, interpret these diagrams literally and treat the vertical direction (along which new branches grow) as a literal spatial direction,
in which we might travel too. This has some wild consequences; here are some games that explore them:

I love this game; it takes a ludicrous idea and carries it to its full extent. Before playing, I worried that it would be too
overwhelming, specially since I lack a solid foundation in chess, but the game is surprisingly approachable, and you'll soon find
yourself having fun. In addition, the well-designed and executed core idea is wrapped in a polished package with great sounds, graphics, and general feel.
Extremely recommended.
