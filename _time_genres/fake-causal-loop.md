Some games in the [Record Clones](/time-genres/record-clones) genre impose an extra restriction: your past selves must not see your current self.
This might seem like a small (and annoying) change, but it does imply a different underlying model of time: each travel isn't creating a parallel
timeline (in which your past self has lost all free will for some unexplained reason); it's taking you to the same unique, unchanging timeline,
in which you simply never saw your future self. This is an ingenious way to make a game based on the [Closed Timelike Curve](/time-genres/closed-timelike-curve)
model without the hassle of controlling several avatars at once. Not being able to see or interact with your past self isn't a requirement: the
Fake Causal Loop model is for any games where the end result is a single consistent timeline, but that don't allow the player to take advantage of the Bootstrap Paradox:
if one locks their car keys inside the car, there is no way to receive from the future a copy of the keys, use them to open the car, and send
the now accessible car keys back in time. This timeline, although stable (and a reasonable level for a [Closed Timelike Curve](/time-genres/closed-timelike-curve)
game), cannot be 'started', so it can't happen on this model.

Here are some games with this model of time travel:

### [Induction](https://store.steampowered.com/app/381890/Induction/) by Bryan Gale


I haven't personally played this game, so I can't talk much about it. It has a very interesting model of time, in which the final result must
be a consistent timeline but you can use [Standard](/time-genres/standard) time travel to get to that state. Probably recommended, will update
this as soon as I play it.

### [Block Pushing Puzzle Game But With Time Travel](https://versificator.itch.io/block-pushing-puzzle-game-but-you-can-time-travel) by Robin Johnson


It's a block pushing game, but... with time travel!. Being grid-based and having undo makes it much less fiddly than the average 
[Record Clones](/time-genres/record-clones) game. It will take some active thought to understand what is going on, so you might be tempted
to key smash randomly until stuff works: don't. Overall a good game. The game feels more about learning general tricks and techniques
than individual puzzles. Highly recommended.

## Variants & future work

A common trope of this model is that the player will actively try not to see the surrounding level, to give room
to their future selves. I think existing games don't stretch this idea as far as it can go. In particular, I'd like to see a game
about moving objects around, where the player might choose to hide an object in a box to avoid seeing it. So, in the first run,
the player might carry an empty box from A to B; they then travel back in time and, without their first self seeing them, store something
in the box while it's at A and take it out once it reaches B. If you find (or make!) a game like this, please contact me, so it can be
featured here!
