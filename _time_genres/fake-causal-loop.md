Some games in the [Past Clones](/time-genres/past-clones) genre impose an extra restriction: your past selves must not see your current self.
This might seem like a small (and annoying) change, but it does imply a different underlying model of time: each travel isn't creating a parallel
timeline (in which your past self has lost all free will for some unexplained reason); it's taking you to the same unique unchanging timeline,
in which you simply never saw your future self. This is an ingenious way to make a game based on the [Closed Timelike Curve](/time-genres/closed-timelike-curve)
model without the hassle of controlling several avatars at once. Unlike that model, however, the player can't take advantage of the Bootstrap Paradox:
if one locks their car keys inside the car, there is no way to receive from the future a copy of the keys, use them to open the car, and send
the now accesible car keys back in time. This timeline, although stable (and a reasonable level for a [Closed Timelike Curve](/time-genres/closed-timelike-curve)
game), cannot be 'started', so it can't happen on this model (which is why I call it "_Fake_ causal loop").

Here are some games with this model of time travel:

### [Block Pushing Puzzle Game But With Time Travel](https://versificator.itch.io/block-pushing-puzzle-game-but-you-can-time-travel) by Robin Johnson

It's a block pushing game, but... with time travel!. Being grid-based and having undo makes it much less fiddly than the average 
[Past Clones](/time-genres/past-clones) game. It will take some active thought to understand what is going on, so you might be tempted
to keysmash randomly until stuff works: don't. Overall a good game, with some exceptions the levels themselves aren't too distinctive
and the game is more about learning tricks and techniques that work on most. Highly recommended.

## Variants & future work

The most distinctive feature about this model is that the player will actively trying not see the level around them, to give room
to their future selves. I think existing games don't stretch this idea as far as it can go. In particular, I'd like to see a game
about moving objects around, where the player might choose to hide the object in a box to avoid seeing it. So, in the first run,
the player might carry an empty box from A to B; they then travel back in time and, without their first self seeing them, store something
in the box while it's at A and take it out once it reaches B. If you find (or make!) a game like this, please contact me so it can be
featured here!
