Do some stuff, go back in time, and watch your past-you clone do the same stuff. This is what most people think about when you tell
them "puzzle game about time travel". My guess is that many devs run into the same big problem of [Standard time travel](/time-genres/standard):
when the player travels back and meets their past self, there are two independent avatars to control! The easy solution is to 
assume that the past player's actions are fixed and play them back. This doesn't actually make sense, though: we're in a new timeline,
and the world has changed, so the past player should be able to 'have chosen' differently. Still, this solution allows creating many
timing based puzzles about planning future actions, which makes it kind of timey enough for someone looking to make a puzzle about time travel.

Here are some games with this model of time travel:

### [The Company of Myself](http://2darray.net/portfolio/the-company-of-myself/) by 2DArray

Story-heavy puzzle platformer from 2009. I remember it as perfect, with clever puzzles and a beautifully tragic story; 
nostalgia might be biasing me, so I won't play it again to avoid it not living up to my expectations. Highly recommended (if not,
please don't tell me).

### [Braid - World 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/) by Jon Blow

Braid's World 5 nicely ties the Record Clones mechanic with its undo: after undoing, there will be a shadow copy of the world performing
any undone actions. This is shown as a parallel, discarded timeline: the shadow player will only interact with the shadow world, avoiding
the logical inconsistency of having the past player's actions be fixed in a changed world. Some special glowing objects do interact
with both worlds at once; this extra level of granularity adds some interesting consequences for the model. The overall game is, of course, highly recommended.

## Variants & future work

You might have guessed it from the rest of the article, but I'm not too fond of this model. Most of the time it's fiddly, requiring either 
superhuman amounts of precise planning or waiting forever while on a button 'just in case', and in general it breaks one of the golden rules of
puzzle games: a solution should take more time to figure out than to execute. I think these flaws could mostly be solved by allowing the
player to freely scrub through the timeline to correct minor mistakes or avoid long waits, but surprisingly I haven't yet seen a game that
does this (apparently easy) fix. If you do, please contact me, so I can feature it here.
