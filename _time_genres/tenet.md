Time machines in fiction usually act instantly: the time traveler always takes the same time to reach their destination, regardless of how far away
(in time) it is. Given that teleporting things around space is kind of a hard problem, it's strange that scientists in fiction jump straight to
being able to teleport things around time. [Primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film)) takes a more grounded approach: to travel 6 hours back in
time, you must sit inside the machine for 6 hours. Maybe in the Primer universe there could be another breakthrough that allows for making faster
time machines, where it only takes 1 subjective hour to travel back 6. Still, this voyage isn't too interesting: the traveler must sit inside a
tiny box, much like an astronaut. Which gets us to the main point of this post: what if the time traveler wasn't confined to their machine but
could explore and interact with the world while travelling backwards in time? This is the core idea of [Tenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)),
a film in which time machines act only as "turnstiles" which swap the time direction of the traveler (from the usual 1 second per 
second, to a shocking -1 second per second). This intriguing flavor of time-reversed travelers can be applied to most models. Here are some
games that do that:

Short puzzle game about reversing the time flow of yourself and other objects. The game uses the [Record Clones](/time-genres/record-clones) model,
but the Tenet flavor removes most of the usual fiddliness. It also has some [Spicy Undo](/time-genres/spicy-undo), with boxes immune to time-reversal.
The logic is simple, consistent, and interesting, and the levels are perfectly crafted to showcase all the interesting consequences of the time travel
model. Highly recommended.
