<!--Like the [Glorified Undo](/time-genres/glorified-undo) model, 
Spicy Undo takes the [growing block view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_block_universe), in which time is built
moment by moment. This growth can be undoed, by removing the top layers of this stack and leaving the universe in a previous state,
after which new layers will grow on top of the new present, overwriting the undoed history. Unlike the 
[Glorified Undo](/time-genres/glorified-undo) model, however, there are objects that are inmune to this undoing. This means that the
undoed, discarded history can have effects on the actual history, which opens up -->

At first sight, this model of time seems very close to the [Glorified Undo](/time-genres/glorified-undo) model: the universe is built
moment by moment, and an undo machine will remove the top layers of this stack. However, there might be objects that resist this undoing,
keeping their history intact. This means that the undoed, discarded history can have effects on the actual history. This view is good
enough to play, create, and understand these games, but will fall apart under closer scrutiny.

is added on top of the universe stack-->
