At first sight, this model of time seems very close to the [Glorified Undo](/time-genres/glorified-undo) model: the universe is built
moment by moment, and an undo machine will remove the top layers of this stack; there might be objects that resist this undoing,
keeping their history intact. This means that the undoed, discarded history can have effects on the actual history. This view is good
enough to play, create, and understand these games, but it's not as solid as it might seem. In particular, the world line of undo-resistant
objects might be discontinous:
![Paradox](/assets/img/spicy-undo-paradox.gif){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
The player never sees the object jump around since by the time they get back to the discontinuity, the object's history will have been rewriten.
There are two solutions: [a hierarchy of extra time dimensions](/time-genres/serialism) (after, the gif above has 2 time dimensions!), or considering these objects
to not have a time dimension. That is, we will see these objects as immutable: they have had and always will have the same position:
![Immutable](/assets/img/spicy-undo-immutable.gif){: .mx-auto.d-block :}
"Wait", you might say, "that object is clearly moving!". Well, from our priviledged outside-the-game perspective it is, but not in the in-game
universe: take a screenshot of that gif and you'll have a stationary object's full timeline. With this view, moving the object means creating
a whole new timeline: not only is the object over there now, it has always been over there for the in-game world inhabitants. The undo machine
isn't actually a machine for undoing history: it's a machine for travelling to alternate timelines in which the immutable objects 
are (and have been, and will be) in a different state.

Here are some games with this model of time travel:

### [Braid - World 3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/26800/Braid/) by Jon Blow

Braid's World 3 features green glowing objects that are immune to the [Glorified Undo](/time-genres/glorified-undo) introduced in World 2.
I can't write anything about Braid that hasn't been writen before; if you're reading a blog about time travel puzzle games, you've played
it already. Higly recommended.

### [So broken](https://coreymartin.itch.io/sobroken) by Corey Martin

Very enjoyable puzzle game that takes standard sokoban and transforms it by making the player immune to undo. Levels are manageable and 
well designed. The addition of a 'Redo' button gives the player a lot of power, once they learn to think about to not overwrite key moves.
Highly recommended. (note: the underlying model for this game is actually [Serailism](/time-genres/serialism), since a redo button is 
incompatible with the [growing block view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_block_universe) that underlies the Spicy and Glorified Undo models.
Still, it makes thematic sense to also link it here.)
