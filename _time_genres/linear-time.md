If [Glorified Undo](/time-genres/glorified-undo) is for games that _technically_ feature time travel but still don't belong in a list of games about
time travel, this page is for games that _technically_ don't feature time travel but still fit with the general spirit of the blog. That is, games
that make the player think about cause and effect, fate and free will, consistency and paradoxes, and the passage of time. Here they are:

### [400 Years](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/610738) by scriptwelder

Short narrative game about waiting. The player's superpower is an incredible patience, which allows them to wait for seasons to pass or trees to grow.
Well written, recommended.

### [Velocity Raptor](https://testtubegames.com/velocityraptor.html) by TestTubeGames

While not actually allowing for time travel (except for [Closed Timelike Curves](/time-genres/closed-timelike-curve)), Special Relativity does wacky 
things to time. Velocity Raptor explores the strange effects of near-light-speed travel; relevant to this blog, it will have you (de)synchronizing
bullets and clocks (from your point of view). The game is too fiddly for my taste, but you can skip levels and even have some sandbox levels
to freely explore the model. Another game that explores these effects is [A Slower Speed of Light](http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/),
but that one doesn't seem to have timing elements.

### [THE LONGING](https://store.steampowered.com/app/893850/THE_LONGING/) by Studio Seufz

Unique game about waiting 400 real-world days. Everything revolves around patience and waiting: the player slowly explores a huge cave system,
where most obstacles are overcome by waiting. As much as we like thinking about time-travelling shenanigans, 
this game reminds us that good old linear time is mysterious and deep enough without any jumps.

### [Z-Rox](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/460260) by Evil-Dog & [Z-Time](https://htwins.net/carelics/Z-Time.html) by Cary Huang

The player must discover what a given image (2D for Z-Rox, 3D for Z-Time) represents. The catch is that one of the images' dimensions
has been swapped for time, leaving a scan-like of the image. In some sense, this model is the exact opposite of [Multiverse Time Travel](/time-genres/multiverse-time-travel),
in which time dimensions are treated as spatial dimensions. Seems like a fun exercise in mental image reconstruction.
The games were made in now-defunct flash; [here's a gameplay video of both](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONOc7IND58w)
