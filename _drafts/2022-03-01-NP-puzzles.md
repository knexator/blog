(WIP)

There's a very special kind of puzzle I love; I like to call them "Alien Computer" puzzles. They feel like you've been given an alien
computing machine and you must find a way to make it output a given result. Thus, the problem has two parts: figuring out how the 
computer works, and figuring out what to input to get the desired output.

by NP-puzzle I mean a puzzle that can be "reduced" to a common NP-complete problem; for example, it might at first feel
 like an impossible combinatorial puzzle about finding the right order of some operations, and the eureka moment is to realize that
 the whole thing can be interpreted as a sudoku.
